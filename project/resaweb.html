        <div>
            <p>Resaweb was the first real website I created on my own. It was developed as part of a school project, serving as the final web development project of my first year in the BUT program. Resaweb is a dynamic website utilizing a database. The languages used were HTML, CSS, and especially PHP, which proved to be very useful.</p><img src="../image/screen_resaweb.png">

        <div>
            <p>Resaweb was designed to be an online booking website. My choice of theme was inspired by a childhood memory: Pok√©mon. I wanted to create a site that, while navigating it, would instantly immerse users in the world of the franchise. My goal was for the site to be dynamic, interactive, colorful, and, above all, functional.</p><img src="../image/screen_resaweb2.png">
